Occurence of an integer in a Linked List

Given a singly linked list and a key, count the number of occurrences of the given key in the linked list.


Examples:

Input: Linked List: 1->2->1->2->1->3->1, key = 1

Output: 4
Explanation: 1 appears 4 times. 


Input: Linked List: 1->2->1->2->1, key = 3

Output: 0
Explanation: 3 appears 0 times


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Approach:
To count the number of occurrences of a given key in a singly linked 
list, we can iterate through the list, check each node's data, and 
increment a counter if the data matches the key. Here’s how you can 
implement the count method:

code Implementation:
class Solution {
    public static int count(Node head, int key) {
        // code here
        
        int count=0;
        Node temp=head;
        
        while(temp!=null){
            if(temp->adta==key){
                count++;
            }
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

Explanation
Initialize a counter count to keep track of occurrences of key.
Traverse the linked list starting from head.
For each node, check if temp->data matches the key. If so, increment count.
Move to the next node until the end of the list is reached.
Return count, which will contain the total occurrences of key.
This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is 
the number of nodes in the linked list, as it needs to visit each 
node once.
