Intersection Point in Y Shaped Linked Lists

Given two singly linked lists, return the point where two linked lists intersect.

Note: If the linked lists do not merge at any point, return -1.


Examples:

Input: Linked list 1: 4->4->4->4->4, Linked list 2: 4->4->4

Output: 4
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 4->4 whose starting point is 4.



Input: Linked list 1: 4->1->8->4->5, Linked List 2: 5->6->1->8->4->5
 
Output: 8
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 8->4->5 whose starting point is 8.


Input: Linked list 1: 1->2->3, Linked list 2: 4->5->6
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no common part, so there is no interaction point.



Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.

Constraints:
2 ≤ size of first linkedist + size of second linkedlist ≤ 2*105
-10000 ≤ data of nodes ≤  10000





class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find intersection point in Y shaped Linked Lists.
    int intersectPoint(Node* head1, Node* head2) {
        // Your Code Here
        Node * l1 = head1 ; 
        Node * l2 = head2 ; 
        while(l1 != l2){
            l1 = l1->next ; 
            l2 = l2->next ; 
            
            if(l1 == NULL){
                l1 = head2 ; 
            }
            if(l2 == NULL){
                l2 = head1 ; 
            }
        }return l1 == NULL ? -1 : l1->data ; 
    }
};
