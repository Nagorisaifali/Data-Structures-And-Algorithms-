Multiply two linked lists

Given elements as nodes of the two singly linked lists.
The task is to multiply these two linked lists, say L1 and L2.

Note: The output could be large take modulo 10^9+7.



Input: LinkedList L1 : 3->2 , LinkedList L2 : 2
Output: 64
Explanation: 

Multiplication of 32 and 2 gives 64.




Input: LinkedList L1: 1->0->0 , LinkedList L2 : 1->0
Output: 1000
Explanation: 

Multiplication of 100 and 10 gives 1000.



Expected Time Complexity: O(max(n,m))
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)
where n is the size of L1 and m is the size of L2
