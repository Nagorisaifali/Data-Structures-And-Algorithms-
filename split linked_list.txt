Split Linked List Alternating

Given a singly linked list's head. Your task is to complete the 
function alternatingSplitList() that splits the given linked list 
into two smaller lists. The sublists should be made from alternating 
elements from the original list.


The sublist should be in the order with respect to the original list.
Your have to return an array containing the both sub-linked lists.


Input: LinkedList = 0->1->0->1->0->1
Output: 0->0->0 , 1->1->1
Explanation: After forming two sublists of the given list as required, we have two lists as: 0->0->0 and 1->1->1



Input: LinkedList = 2->5->8->9->6
Output: 2->8->6 , 5->9
Explanation: After forming two sublists of the given list as required, we have two lists as: 2->8->6 and 5->9.




Input: LinkedList: 7 
Output: 7 , <empty linked list>


Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 100
1 <= node -> data <= 104


vector<Node*> alternatingSplitList(struct Node* head) {
        // Your code here  

        // Dummy nodes to start the two lists
        Node * ptr1 = new Node(0) ; 
        Node * ptr2 = new Node(0) ; 

 

          // Pointers to the current nodes of the two lists
        Node * list1 = ptr1 ; 
        Node * list2 = ptr2 ; 


          // Boolean flag to alternate between the two lists
        bool alternate = true ;
        while(head){
            if(alternate){
                list1->next = head ; 
                list1 = list1->next ; 
            }else{
                list2->next = head ; 
                list2 = list2->next ; 
            }

             // Move to the next node 

            head = head->next ; 
            
            alternate = !alternate ; 
        }

           // Terminate the two lists
        list1->next = NULL ; 
        list2->next = NULL ; 
        

             // Return the heads of the two lists (excluding dummy nodes)
        return {ptr1->next , ptr2->next} ; 
}
